# Plan: new demo module `flink-stateful-ops-agent-demo` (re:Invent OPN303, slides 10–12)

Design notes, decisions and spike findings from building the demo. For what the demo does and how to run it,
start with the [README](../README.md).

## Decisions (2026-10-02)
- Direction: build a new stateful tuning demo around the balanced-scheduling runbook. The original `flink-operations-agent-demo` stays untouched.
- Demo format (2026-10-03): a **pre-recorded video** (7:00, slide 11), not a live demo. No venue network, latency or live-failure risk. Real waits (windows, redeploys, cooldowns) are time-lapsed in editing with an on-screen wall clock. Presenter narrates live over the muted video from `docs/demo-script.md`, so it can be rehearsed.
- LLM (2026-10-03): record with **Ollama qwen3:8b**. It is verified 21/21 and needs no account, so anyone can reproduce the video from the public repo. Bedrock is an optional upgrade if Mayank (AWS) provides an account, and it doesn't block anything.
- Target cluster: Docker, with a JobManager and 3 TaskManagers. Each TaskManager is capped at `TM_CPUS` (default 0.5, also used for recording).
- Target input (2026-10-03): rate-limited to `TARGET_RATE` (default 19000 × `TM_CPUS` = 9,500 events/s), between the skewed and the balanced capacity. The skewed placement falls behind and the balanced one keeps up, so the target Flink UI shows the fix as well as the dashboard.
- flink-agents version: a local build of main + PR #1161, until a release contains the fix. Without it there's no "no double redeploy" beat (see P0 findings).
- The hero job's live fix is NONE → TASKS. The "+50 ms" step stays on the simulated fleet job, because post-failover imbalance didn't reproduce on the hero job (see P0 findings: skew).

## Demo story
1. **The page.** ClickstreamEnrichment is backpressured. "An autoscaler would buy more machines."
2. **The agent waits and remembers.**
   - Per-job keyed state collects evidence across windows: one TaskManager is at 100% CPU with 4 tasks, while another has 2.
   - It loads the runbook skill, records a baseline, and applies `TASKS` scheduling. That side effect runs exactly once.
   - It verifies against the baseline: balanced, throughput up, so KEEP. No new machines.
3. **When the fix doesn't hold** (simulated fleet job): +50 ms, then +50 ms, then it stops and escalates with a report built from its own memory.
4. **Chaos.** Kill the agent mid-action. It recovers from the checkpoint, doesn't redeploy twice, and still remembers.
5. **Close:** "It didn't just answer. It remembered, experimented, and knew when to stop." Then on to slide 12.

## Q&A
**Is the existing ops agent stateless?** Its reasoning is. It runs on a stateful engine but uses Flink only as a runner:
- Only sensory memory, which is wiped after every inspection, so each check starts from zero.
- Every job shares one key (`lambda x: 1`): no per-job memory, and inspections run one at a time.
- Its only "history" is watermark JSON files written by an outside script, which aren't checkpointed.
- No checkpoints or restart strategy: one LLM timeout killed the job.

**How is this different from auto-sizing?**
- An autoscaler is a fixed formula on one metric and one setting (parallelism), and it already exists in the Flink K8s Operator.
- For skew it does the wrong thing: it adds resources, when the real problem is placement. The fix is the same resources, placed better.
- The stateful agent follows a written runbook across several settings (scheduler mode, `slot.request.max-interval`, then a human).
- It runs experiments: baseline → change → verify → keep or revert → escalate with evidence.
- Each decision depends on what it has already tried. That is episodic memory, not a window of metrics.

## Why a new demo (the original's weaknesses)
- The original is basically auto-sizing. The Flink K8s Operator autoscaler already does that without an LLM, so expect the question "why not the autoscaler?"
- It doesn't show anything stateful: one shared key, only sensory memory, history kept in files, no checkpoints or durability, and a cron-like trigger.

## New demo case: "The runbook is stateful" (Flink 2.2 Balanced Tasks Scheduling, FLIP-370)
Every line of the Flink doc's runbook depends on what happened before:
1. "if you are seeing these bottlenecks": the bottleneck must persist across windows; a single snapshot isn't enough.
2. "should not use it if not seeing bottlenecks, may degrade": compare against a baseline and revert if worse.
3. "increase slot.request.max-interval by 50 ms each time": the agent needs the current value and the number of attempts.
4. "if still unbalanced after sufficient increases, report in FLINK-38715": escalate with the full history as evidence.

A stateless, request-driven agent needs an external DB, scheduler, queue and partitioner to follow this runbook. In Flink Agents it is per-job keyed state, checkpointed together with the stream.

## Verified facts (2026-10-01)
- Latest flink-agents release: 0.3.1 (PyPI). It ships dist jars for Flink 1.20, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.
- `taskmanager.load-balance.mode: TASKS` exists only in Flink ≥ 2.2. Flink 1.20 has only NONE/SLOTS.
- `slot.request.max-interval` default is 20 ms (2.2).
- In a Flink 2.2 session cluster, both options are read from the **cluster** config. `JobMasterServiceLeadershipRunnerFactory` passes the cluster `configuration` into `DefaultSlotPoolServiceSchedulerFactory.fromConfiguration`, so a job-level `-D` is ignored. The remedy is to redeploy the target cluster from a savepoint (in production, a FlinkDeployment spec change).
- Stack: Flink 2.2.1, apache-flink 2.2.1, flink-connector-kafka 5.0.0-2.2, flink-agents 0.4-SNAPSHOT built locally from main + PR #1161 (0.4 is not released; see P0 findings: durability).
- Features to use (all are in 0.3.1; the durability fixes are not). Used in the demo: short-term memory,
  the Kafka action state store with `durable_execute_async` and a reconciler, the runbook as a Skill file,
  `output_schema`, and async actions. Considered but not used: memory TTL, MCP, Bedrock (optional, needs AWS
  credentials), and model-driven `load_skill` (see P0 findings: LLM decisions).

## Architecture (a single Flink job; stream processing before reasoning)
```
platform-sim collector (every 3s): real target job (Flink REST) + simulated fleet (21 jobs)
  -> Kafka ops_metrics
  -> parse -> keyBy(job) -> 15s event-time windows -> features (TM task skew, hot-TM CPU, backpressure, throughput)
  -> persistence filter (KeyedProcessFunction): forwards skewed windows with their streak count, the first
     healthy window after them, and 6 windows after every config change; drops the rest
  -> OpsAgent (Flink Agents, keyed by job, parallelism 4)
       memory:     incident (baseline, attempts with before/after, cooldown), escalation, history
       runbook:    skills/balanced-task-scheduling/SKILL.md, loaded into every decision prompt
       decisions:  Ollama qwen3:8b with output_schema (runbook_step, action, rationale)
       guardrails: allowed_actions() per state, 30s cooldown before verify, ESCALATE forced after 3 increases
       side effects (durable_execute_async + reconciler, via the platform-sim REST API): redeploy, escalate
  -> Kafka ops_records -> platform-sim dashboard (http://localhost:8090)
```
- Agent cluster: local Flink 2.2.1 standalone with 2 TaskManagers. It is never restarted by remediation.
- Target cluster: docker compose with a JobManager and 3 TaskManagers (2 slots each, `TM_CPUS` each). The hero job has Enrich at p=6 and SessionScore at p=3, both CPU-heavy. The default strategy gives a 4/3/2 task skew, so the hot TaskManager backpressures.
- Durability: checkpoint every 10s, fixed-delay restart, Kafka action state store.

## Phases (each ends with something that can be demoed)

**Status (2026-10-04):** P0–P4 done and verified end to end on the laptop (`TM_CPUS=0.5`, 9,500 events/s): the hero fix with a real redeploy and KEEP (~7.5k → 9.5k rec/s, backpressure gone), the fleet escalation with the hands-off hold, and the agent TaskManager kill mid-redeploy (restarts 1, redeploys 1, reconciled). P5 is next: record with `docs/recording-runbook.md`.

- P0 spike, about 1 day. Verify on 2.2.1 + 0.3.1 Python:
  - short-term memory persists across runs and checkpoints
  - after a TaskManager kill, durable_execute does not replay the side effect
  - Skills load
  - event log shows in the UI
  - structured output is reliable (Bedrock vs Ollama)
  - the skew reproduces and TASKS mode fixes it
- P1: new module skeleton on Flink 2.2 + main/#1161:
  - key by job_name, parallelism 4
  - checkpoints, restart strategy, Kafka action store
  - memory: baseline, actions, config, cooldown, windows with skew
  - the runbook loaded deterministically; `output_schema` decisions
  - durable side effects (`durable_execute_async` + reconciler): redeploy, escalate
  - manual trigger, start/stop scripts, `setup_flink.sh` for the local build
- P2: stream-first pipeline and fleet simulator (scale: N jobs, 4 subtasks, events→incidents→LLM-call counters).
- P3: hero scenario:
  - SOP as a Skill
  - memory-driven loop: observe → baseline → apply TASKS → verify → keep/revert → +50 ms → escalate
  - real target-cluster redeploy
- P4: demo UX:
  - per-job memory timeline view
  - per-TaskManager CPU bars
  - scene trigger scripts
  - event log
- P5: record and edit the demo video (the primary demo, slide 11). Shoot to `docs/demo-script.md`: its "On screen" lines are the shot list, with chapter cards and hold frames for live narration. Several takes per scene, time-lapse the waits, then a final cut. Hidden slide 18 is redundant.

## Demo video flow (7:00, muted, narrated live; full script in `docs/demo-script.md`)
Talk clock: slide 10 setup 8:00–8:30, video 8:30–15:30, 0:30 slack, slide 12 at 16:00.

| Video time | Beat |
|---|---|
| 0:00 | The Flink doc runbook, highlighting the four stateful phrases |
| 0:45 | Architecture plus Flink UI: agent operator at p=4; N jobs streaming; counters for events, incidents and LLM calls |
| 1:30 | Hero job skewed (CPU bars). The agent waits 3 windows instead of reacting to a blip, and memory shows the baseline |
| 2:45 | Agent applies TASKS (durable side effect), the target redeploys from a savepoint, and the bars even out. Verified against the baseline, so KEEP |
| 4:00 | Fleet job (simulated) where the fix doesn't hold: +50 ms per try until the limit, then escalate with a report built from memory |
| 5:15 | Kill the agent's TaskManager mid-action: it recovers from the checkpoint, does not redeploy twice, and memory is intact |
| 6:30 | Summary card, then click to slide 12 |

Say it rather than show it:
- thousands of jobs through key partitioning
- exactly-once action consistency needs the same per-key order after recovery
- memory TTL
- in production this is a K8s operator spec change, gated by approvals and blast-radius limits

Recording rules:
- Real runs only. Speed up waits but never fake a result, and label the simulated fleet job on screen.
- Show a wall clock (or a "×N" badge) on every time-lapsed segment, so the 3-window wait stays honest.
- Record at 1080p+ with large terminal and UI fonts; the video plays on a big screen.

## Risks
- ~~Whether the skew is deterministic on docker TaskManagers~~ Resolved: NONE skewed 5/5 times, TASKS balanced 4/4 (see P0 findings: skew).
- Post-failover imbalance is not reproducible on demand: 0 of 3 TaskManager kills under TASKS. So the "+50 ms" chapter uses the simulated fleet and must be labeled honestly.
- The Flink throughput meter lags about 65s behind a redeploy. Verify with `target_ctl.measure_throughput` (a 20s counter window) instead.
- ~~Bedrock needs AWS credentials~~ Not blocking: the video is recorded with Ollama qwen3:8b (21/21, ~3.4s per decision). Bedrock is optional.
- The recording and editing time must fit before the deck deadline; leave room for retakes.
- **flink-agents version:** durability needs fixes that aren't in 0.3.1 (see P0 findings).

## P0 findings (2026-10-02): memory and durable execution
The spike lives in `spikes/`. The test kills the agent TaskManager with `kill -9` while actions are in flight.

What we verified:
- Short-term memory survives a TaskManager kill on every version: after restore, `runs` and `history` continue where they left off.
- Per-key concurrency only holds with `async def` actions plus `await ctx.durable_execute_async`. A synchronous action blocks the subtask, so keys on that subtask run one after another.

Durability results by version:

| Version | Kill during APPLY, with reconciler | Kill during APPLY, no reconciler | Kill during OBSERVE (APPLY already done) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.3.1 | ❌ re-applies; restores 0 states | duplicate | ❌ re-applies |
| main 99103da6 | ❌ only correct when no checkpoint lands mid-action | duplicate | ❌ same as left |
| main + PR #1161 (14ee1feb) | ✅ the reconciler finds the receipt and skips | duplicate (expected baseline) | ✅ APPLY result replayed from the store; only OBSERVE re-runs |

Upstream status:
- **#1095 (merged):** cold-start topic-creation timeout.
- **#1101 (merged):** the restore stopped at the first empty poll.
- **#1158 (open):** the recovery marker is the end offset at snapshot time. Python async actions don't block the checkpoint barrier, so durable records written before a checkpoint by still-running actions get skipped. **PR #1161** fixes it and is verified end to end above: the restore now seeks to each in-flight key's latest record.
- **#1174 (open):** the Fluss variant of #1158.

**Decided:** pin the demo to main + #1161, then the first release that contains it. 0.3.1 can't show "no double redeploy".

### Gotchas
1. Don't copy flink-agents dist jars into `$FLINK_HOME/lib` for Python jobs. The duplicate kafka-clients cause a `JmxReporter` ClassCastException.
2. Set `python.executable`, and export `PYTHONPATH=<venv purelib>` before starting TaskManagers (pemja).
3. The agent class must live in an importable module. Submit with `-pym <main> -pyfs <absolute dir>`; a relative `-pyfs .` failed with ModuleNotFoundError.
4. Add `pemja` to `classloader.parent-first-patterns.additional`. Otherwise every restart fails with "Native Library already loaded".
5. The parent-first side effect: a TaskManager's Python module cache outlives the job. **Restart the cluster after changing agent code**, or the old code runs silently.
6. The agent input must be Python objects. Put a `.map(lambda s: s)` after the Java KafkaSource.
7. Read the input with `InputEvent.from_event(event).input`.
8. Building flink-agents from source:
   - compile on JDK 17 (output stays Java 11 bytecode)
   - install the Python package with `FLINK_AGENTS_SKIP_JAR_DOWNLOAD=1`
   - **use `mvn clean install` for the `dist/*` modules.** Without `clean`, maven-shade re-shades the previous jar and the stale runtime classes win.

## P0 findings (2026-10-02): skew and remediation
Setup (measured at `cpus: 1` per TaskManager with unbounded input, before the demo moved to `TM_CPUS=0.5` and a rate-limited source):
- Target cluster: `target-cluster/` (docker, 3 TaskManagers × 2 slots, `cpus: 1` each).
- Hero job: `target-jobs/clickstream-enrichment` (Enrich p=6 → keyBy → SessionScore p=3, both CPU-heavy, unbounded datagen).
- Control: `target-cluster/target_ctl.py`.
- Trial runners: `spikes/skew_trials.py` and `spikes/failover_trials.py`.

| Mode | Trials | Tasks per TaskManager | CPU per TaskManager | Throughput (SessionScore in) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NONE (default) | 5/5 skewed | 4/3/2 or 4/2/3 (the hot TaskManager varies) | 100% / ~68% / ~27% | ~17k rec/s; every Enrich subtask 70–90% backpressured |
| TASKS | 4/4 balanced | 3/3/3 | 100% / 100% / 100% | ~27–28k rec/s (**+60% on the same 3 CPUs**) |
| TASKS, after killing a TaskManager | 3/3 balanced | 3/3/3 | — | job recovered in 16–28s |

- **Remediation:** redeploy the cluster from a savepoint, which takes about 13–16s (`target_ctl.redeploy`). Both options are cluster-level in a session cluster.
- **Metrics:**
  - CPU and busy-time metrics saturate about 16s after a redeploy.
  - `numRecordsInPerSecond` is a 60s meter, so it lags about 65s.
  - The JobManager's REST metric store answers from its *previous* fetch, so call `refresh_metrics()` before reading.
  - `measure_throughput(jid, 20)` agrees with the meter to within 2%.
- **Runbook source:**
  - The Flink **2.2** docs only describe the mechanism, plus "don't use without bottlenecks".
  - The failover note ("increase `slot.request.max-interval` by 50 ms each time … report in FLINK-38715") is in the **2.3/master** docs.
  - The note comes from FLINK-38687 release testing. There the imbalance was random and needed several slot-sharing groups plus spare TaskManagers.
  - The skill should cite both docs pages.
- **Why not the autoscaler:** the backpressure is real, so an autoscaler would add capacity. But the fix is placement, on the same machines.

## P0 findings (2026-10-02): LLM decisions
Spike: `spikes/llm_spike.py` covers 7 runbook scenarios (WAIT, APPLY_TASKS, KEEP, REVERT, INCREASE_INTERVAL, ESCALATE, NO_ACTION). It runs through a flink-agents agent on a PyFlink mini-cluster with Ollama qwen3:8b at temperature 0.

| Variant | Correct | Latency per call |
|---|---|---|
| **Runbook in the system prompt, `output_schema`, no thinking** | **21/21** (3 reps), 0 parse errors, 0 retries | median 3.4s, max 7.1s |
| Same, thinking on | 7/7 | 13–60s (no accuracy gain; slows every take) |
| Runbook as a Skill (model must call `load_skill`), with or without `output_schema`, with or without thinking | 2–3/7: never called `load_skill` | 2–40s |

- The runbook needs an explicit **decision table** (situation → action) plus a `runbook_step` field placed before `action` in the output. With prose alone, the model jumps to APPLY_TASKS (4/7).
- Ollama native structured output (`format`) constrains decoding to the JSON schema, so the model **cannot emit a tool call** while it's on. Even without it, qwen3:8b skips `load_skill` whenever the prompt also asks for JSON (0/6 in direct replays).
- **Decision:** the runbook is still a standard Agent Skill (`skills/balanced-task-scheduling/SKILL.md`, citing the Flink docs), but the agent **loads it deterministically** into every decision prompt. The talking point: "an ops agent shouldn't get to choose whether to read the runbook." Re-test model-driven `load_skill` on Bedrock once credentials exist.
- Python agent jobs: the agent class must be imported from a module, not `__main__`. For local runs use `python -c 'import mod; mod.main()'`, and set `python.executable` to the venv interpreter.
- Event log: `baseLogDir` → `FileEventLogger` writes per-subtask JSONL. Strings are truncated at 2000 chars (`event-log.standard.max-string-length`).

## Local dev safety (the presenter's MacBook: M3 Pro, 12 cores, 36 GB)
- Run with `TM_CPUS=0.5` (the default), so the target cluster is hard-capped at 1.5 cores (~12% of the machine). Record with it too: every timing in `docs/recording-runbook.md` was measured at 0.5.
- Ollama runs only during decisions (~3s bursts).
- Run `bin/demo.sh down --all` whenever a session ends.
- Check `pmset -g therm` for thermal warnings during long runs.
